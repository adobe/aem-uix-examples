# CFtoAdobeTarget

This sample extension uses [UI Extension SDK](https://developer.adobe.com/uix/docs/) to create a custom UI for Content Fragment Core Component.
It allows the user to select a content fragment and export it to Adobe Target.

## Pre-requisites
1. [Set up](https://github.com/adobe/aem-uix-examples/wiki/Exporting-Content-Fragments-to-Adobe-Target#aem-instance-setup) your AEM instance.
2. Make sure that you have [installed aio cli tool](https://developer.adobe.com/uix/docs/guides/local-environment/#manage-aio-cli-tool)
3.  [Create a project](https://developer.adobe.com/uix/docs/guides/creating-project-in-dev-console/) in Adobe Developer Console or use existing one.
## Local Dev

1. Sign in to **aio cli** using `aio login` command.
2. Run `aio app use` command to generate `.env` file.
3. `aio app run` to start your local Dev server
4. App will run on `localhost:9080` by default

Now you can preview your app in the browser: `https://experience.adobe.com/?repo=<CURTOMER_AEM_HOST>#/@<CUSTOMER_IMS_ORG>/aem/cf/admin/`
See this [doc](https://developer.adobe.com/uix/docs/guides/preview-extension-locally/) for step by step instructions.


By default the UI will be served locally but actions will be deployed and served from Adobe I/O Runtime. To start a
local serverless stack and also run your actions locally use the `aio app run --local` option.

## Test & Coverage

- Run `aio app test` to run unit tests for ui and actions
- Run `aio app test --e2e` to run e2e tests

## Deploy & Cleanup

- `aio app deploy` to build and deploy all actions on Runtime and static files to CDN
- `aio app undeploy` to undeploy the app


### `app.config.yaml`

- Main configuration file that defines an application's implementation.
- More information on this file, application configuration, and extension configuration
  can be found [here](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/docs/guides/appbuilder-configuration/#appconfigyaml)


## Debugging in VS Code

While running your local server (`aio app run`), both UI and actions can be debugged, to do so open the vscode debugger
and select the debugging configuration called `WebAndActions`.
Alternatively, there are also debug configs for only UI and each separate action.
